        <p>The Moon is Earth's orbit child. Although lacking in water this moon makes up for its barren landscape by
            providing us with loads of precious metals ready for harvest and trade! We believe due to these economical
            resources that could benefit the federation makes Earth the next ally of alien communications as we all
            could benefit economically and for the sake of expansion!</p>
